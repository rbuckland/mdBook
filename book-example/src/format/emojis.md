# Emoji Support

Emoji allows you to use common `:smile:` :smile: emoji markup in your Markdown files.
This implementation has been inspired from the [markdown-it/markdown-it-emoji](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-emoji) library on NPM.

## Configuration
The Emoji Preprocessor is enabled by 

```
...
[preprocessor]
emoji = true
...
```

or

```
...
[preprocessor.emoji]
...
```

## Examples

- `:white_check_mark:` :white_check_mark:
- `:negative_squared_cross_mark:` :negative_squared_cross_mark:
- `:information_source:` :information_source:
